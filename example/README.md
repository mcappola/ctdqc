To use this example:

1. Clone the repo.
2. Navigate to this folder on your machine in MATLAB.
3. Add the whole repository to your MATLAB PATH.
4. Run "exampleQC('LMG1701_004')" in the terminal. This CNV file is already provided for the example in the "processed" directory.
5. This example will generate many figures, a table of sensor information, and a cleaned up matfile of the data. All output is saved to their respective directories.
6. While this is an example, it can easily be adapted into any workflow. Just put your new CNV files in the "processed" directory.
